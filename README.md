CTF
===
CTF is a simple django capture the flag server. It was designed by request for a Blackhat 2011 talk.
Its simple, quick and easy to set up. Simply deploy to a server and use Nginx to proxy connections.

After it is set up and working then navigate to /admin/ and log in. Create one (and only one) settings object, and as many questions as you wish. Then have a play, the rest should explain itself.
